# Password-Generator

## Objective 

This project is one of my first true projects. My purpose was to make a simple password generator. I had several problems with syntax at first, so I had to look up quite a few elements at the start. Once I figured it out, I decided to add a Password Strength checker as well. Since I created a random generator, the password strength checker reports the same score most of the time, unless I change the max password length. I will need to get back into the code to make it more interesting.
