# Password-Generator

## Objective 

-- This project is one of my first small projects. My purpose was to make a simple password generator. 

-- Since I created a random generator, the password strength checker reports the same score most of the time, unless I change the max password length. I will need to get back into the code to make it more interesting. 

--My biggest takeaway from this small project was the vast amout of strings alreay present in python to pull from.
